	RESULTS
	{
		default = We've gained some more insight on how the kerbal body is affected by microgravity.
		KerbinInSpace = Results show a loss of muscle mass and strength, especially in the lower extremities.
		KerbinInSpace = Bone density appears to decrease with prolonged exposure to microgravity. Kerbals should exercise regularly to maintain their health.
		KerbinInSpace = Fluids tend to pool in the head and torso.
		KerbinInSpace = Researchers note a performance decrease in the cardiovascular system and a weakened immune system. Recommend regular exercise.
		KerbinInSpace = Kerbals prefer solid foods and ice cream to eating pastes from tubes.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = Increased levels of cellular damage is noted further from Kerbin's magnetosphere.  Increasing radiation shielding is recommended.  As a side note, Bill now glows slightly.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = High orbit does not appear to significantly change effects to bone and muscle density vs. low orbit.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = Kerbals like looking at the stars.  Could we get a window?

		MunSrfLanded = Muscle mass and strength loss is mitigated by the 0.166g gravitational field on Mun's surface.  But only slightly.
		MunSrfLanded = Researchers note an unexpected increase in performance of the cardiovascular system from living on the Mun.  As a side note, jumping in low gravity is fun.
		MunSrfLanded = A strange burning smell has been traced to the dust tracked in by returning EVAs.  Bob has advised everyone to not panic - it appears to be the scent of Mun dust, and does not mean there's an actual fire.

		MinmusInSpace = In a completely unexpected finding, orbiting Minmus appears to be the same as orbiting Kerbin for designing hammers.  There have been some interesting ideas for ice cream scoops though.
		MunSrfLanded = Screwdriver designs for the Mun appear to be much easier than for microgravity.  It has to do with Bill being able to put his feet on the ground.

		KerbinInSpaceHigh = Crystals in space tend to be thinner and spikier than those grown closer to the planetary surface.
		MunSrfLanded = Crystals grown on beds of Munar regolith exhibit some fascinatingly unusual grow patterns.  Further research will be needed to see if they are useful for anything.
		MunSrfLanded = Mun's low gravity means that crystals grown on it's surface are very similar to crystals grown in space.  It might be worth setting up a production facility.

		EveInSpace = What does the sample taste like? How does it make you feel? What if you exercice while eating the ice cream? Quick, answer! So much pressure...

		BopInSpace = We considered mixing in the blood of a kraken into the ice cream, but that's just gross.
		PolInSpace = This experimental flavor of ice cream may cause allergic reactions.
		TyloInSpace = This batch of ice cream is particularly dense and creamy.
		LaytheInSpace = At first glance this ice cream flavor looks idyllic, but upon sampling it, it's not very tasty.
		VallInSpace = You come up with the idea of adding blueberries and blue tint to the ice cream.
		DresInSpace = This batch of ice cream has chunks of ice in it. It's a complete disaster. Hm...
		EelooInSpace = After looking at the window, you decide to add cookies and cream into the mixture.
		MinmusSrfLanded = The surface of Minmus is *not* repeat *not* made of ice cream.  On an unrelated note, does Jeb have that shipment of packaging equipment ready to send up yet?
		MinmusSrfLanded = Rumors that we are shipping Minmus home as ice cream are completely untrue.  It'd be to expensive.
		MunSrfLanded = Munar regolith appears to be a decent insulation material for ice cream containers, once stabilized.
		DunSrfLanded = Sitting out on the rolling red plains, eating ice cream...  It gives you time to think and reflect on the big questions in life, like 'Why am I here?', or 'What is my purpose in life?', or 'Do we have any food that isn't ice cream?', or 'Shouldn't I be wearing a helmet?'

		KerbinInSpace = Measuring the temperature of space appears to be very hard - we are getting the temperature of our ship, not the surrounding vacuum.
		KerbinInSpace = Temperature readings appear to be largely dependent on whether the thermometer is exposed to Kerbol at the time of the reading.

		KerbinInSpace = The goo appears to be liquid enough for surface tension to form it into a stable sphere.  Well, unless it gets bumped.  Then it wiggles a bit until it's a sphere again.  Um, what was that about learning about the formation of the Mun?

General health appears fine despite that, but further testing is warranted.

		MinmusSrfLanded = While the material samples were processed, you began to turn your thoughts to how much Minmus looks like a mint dessert, and have discovered that you are now hungry.

		InSpace = The high radiation environment caused a few of the samples to glow. It looks like it would be fun to paint the rocket with this.

		EveSrfLanded = The crushing pressure of the atmosphere is causing some of the materials to crystallize rapidly.
		EveSrfLanded = You're not sure if most of the samples changed color, or if it's just the lighting...
		EveFlyingHigh = The extremely dense atmosphere strips the contents of the materials bay.
		EveFlyingLow = The atmosphere appears to either polish or strip the material, depending on its composition.

		GillySrfLanded = The samples appear to behave like they're in low orbit of Kerbin.
		GillySrfLanded = Some of the surface material has mixed with the contents of the bay. You write down the results for good measure.

		DunaSrfLanded = Opening the sample container you find that everything has turned red. Initial tests show that it'll never wash out of white space suits. You consider sending missions in pink EVA suits to reduce cleaning costs.
		DunaSrfLanded = The sample computer processes the results. It's massive red eye seems to be at home here as it slowly, ominously, blinks.

		IkeSrfLanded = One of the samples has reacted very strangely to the surface of Ike.
		IkeSrfLanded = One of the crystal samples explodes and throws green shards out of the materials bay!

		DresSrfLanded = As the samples process, the computer asks if it can sing you a song while it works. Apparently the song is about a flower of some kind.
		DresSrfLanded = One of the samples evaporates when exposed the environment.

		JoolInSpace = The computer gave an odd report no matter how many times we sent the request. Open the sample bay doors... "I'm sorry, I'm afraid I can't let you do that," was the only reply. The doors did open very promptly, however, when we opened the fusebox panel. Very curious.		
		JoolFlyingHigh = The intense, crushing pressure has drastically changed the composition of the materials. Super heating and ablation effects have been observed. The science bay is looking very disgruntled.
		JoolFlyingLow = The samples burn, boil, or crumple under the extreme pressures and heat. The visual camera shows a wonderful rainbow of colors before it cuts out.
		JoolSrfLanded = You're not sure where the container stops and the samples start anymore...

		LaytheFlyingHigh = One of the samples burns on contact with the atmosphere. Interestingly, the color indicates the presence of oxygen.
		LaytheFlyingLow = The sample smolders and pops as it burns up.
		LaytheSrfLanded = The fine, particulate sand of Laythe blows into the sample bay.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = The sample bay power supply begins to short out! Electricity arcs and etches into the samples of the bay. It's quite the display!

		VallSrfLanded = Many of the samples either freeze or evaporate from the sample container.
		VallSrfLanded = The container sample door freezes up, before finally continuing to open. A thin coating forms on the surface of the samples.

		TyloSrfLanded = One of the samples shatters into a fine mist when exposed to the surface of Tylo.
		
		BopSrfLanded = The samples appear to be having a chemical reaction with the surface of Bop.
		BopSrfLanded = All of the liquid samples instantly evaporate.

		PolSrfLanded = Some of the samples pit and melt when they come in contact with the surface of Pol!

		EelooSrfLanded = Some of the fine crystals lining Eeloo enter the materials bay. It also appears that some of the samples have become more conductive in the extreme cold.
