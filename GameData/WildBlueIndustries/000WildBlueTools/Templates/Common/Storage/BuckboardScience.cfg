	description = This kit is used to transport various science experiments to another vessel or to bring them back to Kerbin to reap the rewards. In the VAB/SPH, you can open the experiment manifest window to select one of the experiment slots, and then choose an experiment from the available list. In flight, you can transfer experiments into and out of the Coach to any part that supports an experiment manifest. If an experiment has been completed, it can only be tranfered one last time, so be sure to make the right choice.
