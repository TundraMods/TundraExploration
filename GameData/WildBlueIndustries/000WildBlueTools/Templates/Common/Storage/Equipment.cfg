//Generic stuff needed for reconfiguring, maintaining, and repairing various WBI parts.
//This is one of the exceptions to the 5-liters per unit definition found throughout Classic Stock.
//Equipment was made back when I didn't realize that RocketParts was a 5-liter resource and my storage
//containers had too much of the stuff. So I switched to Equipment and made it a 1-liter resource.
//I don't want to go through that again so we keep Equipment as a 1-liter resource.
