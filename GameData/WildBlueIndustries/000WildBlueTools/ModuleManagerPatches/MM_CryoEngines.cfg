//vLH2=VLOX*5
//LH2: Liters
//Oxidizer: 5Liters
//Standard ratio is 3 LH2 to 0.2 Oxidizer- for every 3 units of LH2, you get 0.2 units of Oxidizer.
//For every 15 units of LH2, you get 1 unit of Oxidizer
//My standard tanks have 5600 liters total volume per 1 unit of capacityFactor.
// 5600 / 16 (15 units of LH2 + 1 unit of Oxidizer) = 350.
