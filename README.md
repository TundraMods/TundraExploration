# TundraExploration
This mod was originally created by @tygoo7 and will be continued by me. Tundra Exploration will continue to focus on stock-alike SpaceX and various other space related parts in KSP. Expect many more parts to be added in the future. If you have any suggestions, please leave a comment

# Current parts

- Rodan (Crew & Cargo Dragon V2)
- Gigan (Cargo Dragon (CRS1
- Ghidorah 9 (Falcon 9)
- Ghidorah Heavy (Falcon Heavy)
- Gojira (Starship 2019)
- Mothra One (Falcon 1)

# Known issues

- Landing Gojira might be hard. A guide is being made to teach you how to use Gojira.
- Caution using Gojira for stations, it can wobble and break it. Use "Autostruts" on Gojira for a temporary fix!
- No IVA on Gojira.
